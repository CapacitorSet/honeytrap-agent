Description: will listen on the configured ports and forward all traffic to Honeytrap
 This allows to run Agent and Honeytrap on different locations, but keeping metadata as the address of the attacker. The Agent can be used as well to forward only certain traffic to Honeytrap, like forwarding only traffic from specific countries to Honeytrap.
